# todo-list-neumorphism
i'm trying to create a simple javascript project, and inspired by a youtube videos from CodingNepal channel, 
here is a todo list with neumorphism style using html, css, and javascript.

the features contained in this todo list app are:
- add new list
- mark the list as done
- delete undone list
- delete done list

this todo list app also implemented local storage.
